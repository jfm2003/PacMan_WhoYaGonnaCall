A Python-based AI agent that uses Bayesian inference, variable elimination, and particle filtering to track invisible ghosts in the Pac-Man maze. Developed as part of the AI curriculum at the University of Washington, adapted from UC Berkeleyâ€™s Pac-Man AI projects.

This project implements intelligent tracking agents capable of estimating ghost positions using noisy distance sensors and probabilistic reasoning. Agents update beliefs over time and make decisions using both exact and approximate inference.
